This is the hand track libraray, which will detect your face and hand movement. And based on these tracking it will provide you the results in the console, so you can execute any kind of logic according to your scenario. To play pong game with hand tracking, enable your video and bring your hand in front of the webcame and just move your hand. If planck is not moving correctly, then try to set your face little bit away from video canvas. Thanks ♥
